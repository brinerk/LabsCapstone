    "In a scattering experiment you usually know the intital velocities of the particles and you want to calculate, or measure the final velocities of the particles. In a one dimensional collision we can calculate the final velocities of the particles if the collision is elastic. If the collision is inelastic we need to measure the final velocity of at least one of the particles, or we must know something about the dynamics of the collision. As we will see the two dimensional case is more complicated.\n",

    "What can we say about the collision from the kinematics alone? Well, it's fair to say that we don't know anything about the forces acting on the particles during the collision.

Knowing that the total energy is conserved is not very useful since there is no guarantee that the mechanical energy is conserved.

You should then repeat the experiment but this time spin the puck you are going to slide into the stationary puck. For your last experiemnt use two pucks with velcro and spin the moving puck. To capture the video we will use a high speed digital camera and it's related software. Once you have your video captured, copy the movie to a USB disc. Make sure that you give your file a unqiue name. You can now analyze your data from any computer (Mac or PC) in room 300.\n",

    "There are three critial points to remember when taking your data:<br>\n",
    "1) You will need to be able to convert from pixels to meters. To enable your to do this you should place a meter stick at the edge of the air table when filming. This will allow you to calculate a scale factor for converting distances in pixels to meters.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2) Make sure you capture your video at about 59.37 frams per second. This option is set via the camera's software interface. The choice of this frequency eliminates flick from the lights and allows a sufficient number of frames to be analyzed before and after the collisions.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3) Make sure that you start filming before you launch the puck and keep filming until the pucks hit the edges of the air table. Since you can select the start and end frames when analyzing in ImageJ, you can afford to film a few extra seconds (not minutes) of video."
