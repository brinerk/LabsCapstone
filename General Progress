Lab 5 and 6 Converted perfectly

Lab 7 completed. 

8 has theory problems that sympy cannot solve: Taylor Series
    Copy equations from mathematica when not possible, write down closest attempts as well (comment). Provide theory solutions. (maybe use python wolfram language)


Lab 9 worked almost perfectly, but some of the sympy equations are slightly different

Lab 10 I have no idea how to approach, major rework (maybe use voxels?)

Lab 11 Converted successfully, but need data to match the mathematica book

Lab 12 In progress, need some test data to figure out if code even works, write out instructions for imagej, curve_fit
    On hold until I have some actual data, hard to finish the remaining parts without it.

Lab 13 Theory copied well, Entire section on animations. Not sure how best to do this. Possibly use manim(?), but this is not necessarily easy. Lab is finished, aside from animations.

Lab 14 done, need animations.

Lab 15 needs data (actually maybe just fake some data for the theory, it's just to show you can import)

notes:
When using paramaters use curve_fit
