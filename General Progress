Lab 5 and 6 Converted perfectly

Lab 7, 8 have theory problems that sympy cannot solve <- copy equation from mathematica when not possible, write down closest attempts as well (comment), Use curve fit for 7, provide theory solutions for 8
>Lab 7 completed
Lab 8 taylor series(?) do it numerically? <- would be major diversion. (just copy from mathematica) (maybe use python wolfram language)

Lab 9 worked almost perfectly, but some of the sympy equations are slightly different
Lab 10 I have no idea how to approach, major rework (maybe use voxels?)
Lab 11 Converted successfully, but need data to match the mathematica book
Lab 12 In progress, need some test data to figure out if code even works, write out instructions for imagej

notes:
When using paramaters use curve_fit
