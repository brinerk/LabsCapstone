    "In this labs, you will use an ultra-sonic range finder to track the position, velocity and acceleration of your lab partner, who will be attemping to satisfy:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Constant, nonzero position, </li>\n",
    "    <li> Constant, nonzero velocity, and </li>\n",
    "    <li> Constant, nonzero acceleration. </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "(Not all at the same time, of course)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h2> Experimental Set Up </h2>\n",
    "Attach the range finder to one of the tubestands and find a space where you can move about 4 meters back from the range finder. You are now ready to track your lab partner. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataStudio software uses a box that emits ultra-sonic pulses and determines the position of a target by measuring the time delay of the reflected pulse. For the hardware to work correctly you must be at least 1/2 meter away from the range finder. The range finder will detect the closest object to it. To start the DataStudio software open the folder titled DataStudio and double click on the DataStudio program. Your lab instructor will show you how to setup the software for your data runs. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To save a data set in a form we can use, go to the File menu and select Export Data. When the dialog box comes up choose the type of data you wish to export. Export each the position, velocity, and acceleration data. This will write an ASCI file that Python can read.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment you will make your own position file. One member of the group should stand in front of the motion sensor and attempt to move at constant position, then at constant velocity, and finally at constant acceleration. You will have 3 data runs at the end of data acquisition.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Analyzing the Data</h2>\n",
    "You can use Python to analyze your data. The object is to determine the velocity and acceleration of your lab partner as a function of both position and time.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataStudio software writes the data as a two column list. The first column is the time data, the second column is the position (or other type) data, You need to find the file path to your data file. Which should look something like:\n",
