    "We will assume that the distance between the screen and the aperture is large, while the aperture itself is small.  If the screen if far enough way from the aperture, then the waves that hit the screen are essentially plane waves. This case is call Fraunhofer diffraction. If the diffracted waves are not plane waves, then we instead have Fresnel diffraction. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_diffraction\">Fresnel diffraction</a> is much more complicated, so for this experiment, we will look only at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_diffraction\">Fraunhofer diffraction</a>.)\n",

    "Huygens principal tells us that when the plane waves hit the aperture they generate spherical wavelets (known as Huygens wavelets). These wavelets propagate only in the forward direction. The figure below shows Huygens wavelets being generated from three positions (the green dots) but in fact every point in the aperture serves as a source for Huygens wavelets. We will calculate the diffraction pattern due to $N_i$ sources each occupying a length $\\Delta y$ and then take the limit as $N_i \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $\\Delta y \\rightarrow 0$."
