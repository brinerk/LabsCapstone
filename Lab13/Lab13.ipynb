    "<h2>Simple Harmonic Motion</h2>\n",
    "Simple harmonic motion plays a central role in much of physics and engineering. The description is used widely for disparate phenomena such as oscillations in an AC circuit, the bending of a bridge, and teh quantum mechanics of light. The prototypical simple harmonic oscillator is a mass on an ideal spring (i.e. one which obeys Hooke's Law). The restoring force provided by the spring is $F = -kx$ where $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium and $k$ is the spring constant.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The equation of motion for the mass is:<br>\n",
    "$m \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = - kx$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "which we can rewrite as:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 x = 0 \\quad (1)$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "where:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "is called the \"angular frequency\" of the system (not to be confused with the \"frequency\" $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Equation (1) is a second order differential equation to solve for $x(t)$. There are two very common forms for the general solution of this equation:\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue\">Solution 1: Sines and Cosines</h3>\n",
    "The solution of (1) will be a function which, when differentiated twice, will give us the original function times a constant. The obvious choice is either sine or cosine. However, this is a second-order differential equation, so there need to be two arbitrary constants in the full general solution. Let's use a linear combination of <i>both</i> sine and cosine:"
