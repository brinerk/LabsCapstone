    "The DataStudio software uses a box that emits ultra-sonic pulses and determines the position of a target by measuring the time delay of the reflected pulse. For the hardware to work correctly you must be at least 1/2 meter away from the range finder. The range finder will detect the closest object to it. To start the DataStudio software open the folder titled DataStudio and double click on the DataStudio program. Your lab instructor will show you how to setup the software for your data runs. <br><br>\n",
